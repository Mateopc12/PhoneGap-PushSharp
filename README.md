PhoneGap-PushSharp
==================

Get Stated with the Push Notification for Android and iOS on a .Net server and PhonegapBuild

First... Lets care about the certificates!
After the App is created and the push notification is enabled, you need to create a Certificate and a Provisional Profile that PhonegapBuild accepts as appropriate for push notifications.

On the "Certificates" section you must create a -App Store and Ad Hoc- under the Distribution section.
